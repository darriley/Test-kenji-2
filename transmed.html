<h1>Transmission media</h1> <p>can be defined as physical path between transmitter and receiver in a
data transmission system. And it may be classified into two types as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<h1>Guided</h1> <p>Transmission capacity depends critically on the medium, the length, and whether
the medium is point-to-point or multipoint (e.g. LAN). Examples are coaxial cable, twisted
pair, and optical fiber.</p>
<h1>Unguided</h1> <p>provides a means for transmitting electro-magnetic signals but do not guide
them. Example wireless transmission.</p>

<h1>TWISTED PAIR CABLE</h1>
<p> A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern. A
wire pair acts as a single communication link. Typically, a number of these pairs are bundled
together into a cable by wrapping them in a tough protective sheath. Over longer distances
cables may contain hundreds of pairs. The twisting tends to decrease the crosstalk
interference between adjacent pairs in a cable. Neighboring pairs in a bundle typically have
somewhat different twist lengths to reduce the crosstalk interference. On long-distance links
the twist length typically varies from 5 to 15 cm. The wires in a pair have thicknesses of from 0 4 to 0 9 mm.</p>

<h1>COAXIAL CABLE</h1>
<p>Coaxial cable, like twisted pair, consists of two conductors, but is constructed differently to permit
it to operate over a wider range of frequencies. It consists of a hollow outer cylindrical conductor that
surrounds a single inner wire conductor. The inner conductor is held in place by either regularly spaced
insulating rings or a solid dielectric material. The outer conductor is covered with a jacket or shield.A
single coaxial cable has a diameter of from 1 to 2.5cm. Coaxial cable can be used over longer
distances and support more stations on a shared line than twisted pair.</p>

<h1>FIBER OPTIC CABLE</h1>
<p>An optical fiber is a thin (2 to 125 um).flexible medium capable of guiding an
optical ray. Various glasses and plastics can be used to make optical fibers. The
lowest losses have been obtained using fibers of Ultrapure fused silica. Ultrapure
fiber is difficult to manufacture: higher loss multicomponent glass fibers are more
economical and still provide good performance. Plastic fiber is even less costly and can be used for
short-haul links, for which moderately high losses are acceptable.</p>

<h1>What is shielded twisted pair (STP)?</h1>

<p>Shielded twisted pair (STP) is a special kind of copper telephone and local area 
network (LAN) wiring used in some business installations. It adds an outer 
covering or shield that functions as a ground to ordinary twisted pair wiring.</p>

<h1>What is an unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP) cable?</h1>

<p>UTP cable is a type of copper cable widely used for networking purposes.
UTP cables consist of pairs of insulated wires that are twisted together to
reduce interference and crosstalk. They are commonly used in Ethernet
networks for transmitting data signals.</p>
