<h1>Operating System</h1>
<h1>What is an operating system?
<p>An operating system (OS) is the program
that, after being initially loaded into the
computer by a boot program, manages all
of the other application programs in a
computer. The application programs
make use of the operating system by
making requests for services through a
defined application program interface
(APl). In addition, users can interact
directly with the operating system
through a user interface, such as a
command-line interface (CLI) or a
graphical UI (GUI).</p>

<h1>Why use an operating system?</h1>
<p>An operating system brings powerful
benefits to computer software and
software development. Without an
operating system, every application
would need to include its own Ul, as well
as the comprehensive code needed to
handle all low-level functionality of the
underlying computer, such as disk
storage, network interfaces and so on.
Considering the vast array of underlying
hardware available, this would vastly
bloat the size of every application and
make software development impractical.</p>

<h1>What are the functions of an
operating system?</h1>
<p>An operating system provides three
essential capabilities: It offers a UI
through a CL| or GUI; it launches and
manages the application execution; and
it identifies and exposes system
hardware resources to those applications
- typically, through a standardized API.
UI. Every operating system requires a Ul,
enabling users and administrators to
interact with the 0S in order to set up,
configure and even troubleshoot the
operating system and its underlying
hardware. There are two primary types of
Ul available: CLI and GUI.</p>

<p>The CLI, or terminal mode window
provides a text-based interface where
users rely on the traditional keyboard to
enter specific commands, parameters
and arguments related to specific tasks,
The GUI, or desktop, provides a visual
interface based on icons and symbols
where users rely on gestures delivered by
human interface devices, such as
touchpads, touchscreens and mouse
devices.
The GUI is most frequently used by casual
or end users that are primarily interested
in manipulating files and applications,
such as double-clicking a file icon to open
the file in its default application. The CLI
remains popular among advanced users
and system administrators that must
handle a series of highly granular and
repetitive commands on a regular basis,
such as creating and running scripts to
set up new personal computers (PCs) for
employees.</p>

<h1>Application management</h1> 
<p> An operating
system handles the launch and
management of every application. This
typically supports an array of behaviors,
including timesharing multiple processes,
or threads, so that various tasks can
share the available processors' time;
handling interruptions that applications
produce to gain a processor's immediate
attention, ensuring there is enough
memory to execute the application and its
corresponding data without interfering
with other processes; carrying out error
handling that can gracefully remove an
application's processes; and performing
memory management without disrupting
other applications or the OS</p>

<p>Additionally, an operating system can
perform the following services for
applications:
In a multitasking operating system
where multiple programs can be
running at the same time, the OS
determines which applications should
run in what order and how much time
should be allowed for each
application before giving another
application a turn.
It handles input/output (1/0) to and
from attached hardware devices, such
as hard disks, printers and dial-up
ports.
It sends messages to each
application or interactive user -- or to
a system operator -- about the status
of operation and any errors that may
have occurred.
It can offload the management of
batch jobs -- for example, printing -- so
that the initiating application is freed
from this work.
On computers that can provide
parallel processing, an operating
system can manage how to divide the
program so that it runs on more than
one processor at a time.</p>

<h1>Device management</h1> An operating
<p>system is responsible for identifying
configuring, and providing applications
with common access to underlying
computer hardware devices. As the os
recognizes and identifies hardware, the
OS will install corresponding device
drivers that enable the 0S and
applications running on the OS to use the
devices without any specific knowledge
of the hardware or devices</p>

<h1>Operating system types and
examples</h1>
<p>Although the fundamental roles of an
operating system are ubiquitous, there are
countless operating systems that serve a
wide range of hardware and user needs.</p>

<h1>General-purpose operating system</h1><p> A
general-purpose OS represents an array of
operating systems intended to run a
multitude of applications on a broad
selection of hardware, enabling a user to
run one or more applications or tasks
simultaneously. A general-purpose OS
can be installed on many different
desktop and laptop models and run
applications from accounting systems to
databases to web browsers to games.
General-purpose operating systems
typically focus on process (thread) and
hardware management to ensure that
applications can reliably share the wide
range of computing hardware present.</p>

<h1>Common desktop operating systems
include the following:</h1>
<p>Windows is Microsoft's flagship
operating system, the de facto
standard for home and business
computers. Introduced in 1985, the
GUI-based OS has been released in
many versions since then. The user-
friendly Windows 95 was largely
responsible for the rapid development
of personal computing
Mac OS is the operating system for
Apple's Macintosh line of PCs and
workstations.
Unix is a multiuser operating system
designed for flexibility and
adaptability. Originally developed in
the 1970s, Unix was one of the first
operating systems to be written in the
Clanguage.
Linux is a Unix-like operating system
that was designed to provide PC
users a free or low-cost alternative.
Linux has a reputation as an efficient
and fast-performing system</p>

<h1>Mobile operating system</h1> <p>Mobile
operating systems are designed to
accommodate the unique needs of
mobile computing and communication-
centric devices, such as smartphones and
tablets. Mobile devices typically offer
limited computing resources compared to
traditional PCs, and the OS must be
scaled back in size and complexity in
order to minimize its own resource use,
while ensuring adequate resources for
one or more applications running on the
device. Mobile operating systems tend to
emphasize efficient performance, user
responsiveness and close attention to
data handling tasks, such as supporting
media streaming. Apple iOs and Google
Android are examples of mobile operating
systems.</p>

<h1>Embedded operating system</h1> <p> Not all
computing devices are general purpose. A
huge assortment of dedicated devices --
including home digital assistants.
automated teller machines (ATMs).
airplane systems, retail point of sale
(POS) terminals and internet of things
(loT) devices -- includes computers that
require an operating system. The principal
difference is that the associated
computing device only does one major
thing, so the OS is highly stripped down
and dedicated to both performance and
resilience. The OS should run quickly, not
crash, and handle all errors gracefully in
order to continue operating in all
circumstances. In most cases, the OS is
provided on a chip that is incorporated
into the actual device. A medical device
used in a patient's life support equipment,
for example, will employ an embedded OS
that must run reliably in order to keep the
patient alive. Embedded Linux is one
example of an embedded OS.</p>

<h1>Network operating system</h1> <p>A network
operating system (NOS) is another
specialized OS intended to facilitate
communication between devices
operating on a local area network (LAN)
A NOS provides the communication stack
needed to understand network protocols
in order to create, exchange and
decompose network packets. Today, the
concept of a specialized NOS is largely
obsolete because other OS types largely
handle network communication. Windows
10 and Windows Server 2019, for
example, include comprehensive
networking capabilities. The concept of a
NOS is still used for some networking
devices, such as routers, switches and
firewalls, and manufacturers may employ
proprietary NOSes, including Cisco
Internetwork Operating System (IOS),
RouterOS and ZyNOS.</p>

<h1>Real-time operating system</h1> <p>When a
computing device must interact with the
real world within constant and repeatable
time constraints, the device manufacturer
may opt to use a real-time operating
system (RTOS). For example, an industrial
control system may direct the operations
of a sprawling factory or power plant
Such a facility will produce signals from
myriad sensors and also send signals to
operate valves, actuators, motors and
countless other devices. In these
situations, the industrial control system
must respond quickly and predictably to
changing real-world conditions --
otherwise, disaster may result. An RTOS
must function without buffering
processing latencies and other delays,
which are perfectly acceptable in other
types of operating systems. Two
examples of RTOSes include FreeRTOS
and VxWorks.</p>
