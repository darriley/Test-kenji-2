<h1> Workgroup </h1>

<p>In computer networking a work group is
collection of computers connected on a LAN
that share the common resources and
responsibilities. Workgroup is Microsoft's
term for a peer-to-peer local area network
Computers running Microsoft operating
systems in the same work group may share
files, printers, or Internet connection.[1] Work
group contrasts with a domain, in which
computers rely on centralized authentication.</p>

<p>If you use multiple computers in your
business you can assign them to multiple
workgroups. You can join existing
workgroups on your network at any time and
organize your computers as you see fit.
Before you can view other workgroups and
connect to their computers in your business
network, you must configure Windows 7 and
enable the network discovery feature.</p>
