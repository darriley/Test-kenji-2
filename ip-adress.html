<h1>IP Address</h1>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device
connected to the internet.</p>
<p>An IP address definition is a numeric label assigned to devices that use the internet to
communicate. Computers that communicate over the internet or via local networks share
information to a specific location using IP addresses.</p>
<p>IP addresses have two distinct versions or standards. The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
address is the older of the two, which has space for up to 4 billion IP addresses and is assigned
to all computers. The more recent Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) has space for trillions of IP
addresses, which accounts for the new breed of devices in addition to computers.</p>
<p>There are also several types of IP addresses, including public, private, static, and dynamic IP
addresses.</p>

<h1>How Does an IP Address Work?</h1>
<p>An IP address works in helping your device, whatever you are accessing the internet on, to find
whatever data or content is located to allow for retrieval</p>
<p>Common tasks for an IP address include both the identification of a host or a network or
Identifying the location of a device.</p>
<p>An IP address is not random. The creation of an IP address has the basis of math. The Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates the IP address and its creation.</p>
<p>The full range of IP addresses can go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.</p>

<h1>Public IP Address</h1>
<p>A public IP address, or external-facing IP address, applies to the main device people use to connect
their business or home internet network to their internet service provider (ISP).1</p>
Private IP Address
<p>A private IP address, or internal-facing IP address, is assigned by an office or home intranet (or local
area network) to devices, or by the internet service provider (ISP).</p>
Static IP Address
<p>All public and private addresses are defined as static or dynamic. An IP address that a person manually
configures and fixes to their device's network is referred to as a static IP address. A static IP address
cannot be changed automatically. An internet service provider may assign a static IP address to a user
account. The same IP address will be assigned to that user for every session.</p>
Dynamic IP Address
<p>A dynamic IP address is automatically assigned to a network when a router is set up. The Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) assigns the distribution of this dynamic set of IP addresses. The
DHCP can be the router that provides IP addresses to networks across a home or an organization.</p>


<h1>Class A Network</h1>
<p>This IP address class is used when there are a large number of hosts. In a Class A type of network.
the first 8 bits (also called the first octet) identity the network, and the remaining have 24 bits for the
host into that network.</p>
<p>An example of a Class A address is 102.168.212.226. Here, "102" helps you identity the network and
168.212.226 identity the host.</p>
<p>Class A addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 cannot be used and ls reserved for loopback and
diagnostic functions.</p>
<h1>Class B Network</h1>
<p>In a B class IP address, the binary addresses start with 10. In this IP address, the class decimal number
that can be between 128 to 191. The number 127 is reserved for loopback, which is used for internal
testing on the local machine. The first 16 bits (known as two octets) help you identify the network. The
other remaining 16 bits indicate the host within the network.</p>
<p>An example ot Class B IP address is 168.212.226.204. where *168 212" identifies the network and
*226.204" helps you identify the Hut network host.</p>
<h1>Class C Network</h1>
<p>Class C is a type of IP address that is used for the small network. In this class, three octets are used
to indent the network. This IP ranges between 192 to 223.</p>
<p>In this type of network addressing method, the first two bits are set to be 1, and the third bit is set to 0,
which makes the first 24 bits of the address them and the remaining bit as the host address. Mostly
local area network used Class C IP address to connect with the network.</p>
<p>Example for a Class C IP address:</p>
<p>192.168.178.1</p>
<h1>Class D Network</h1>
<p>Class D addresses are only used for multicasting applications. Class D is never used for regular
networking operations. This class addresses the first three bits set to "1" and their fourth bit set to use
for "0". Class D addresses are 32-bit network addresses. All the values within the range are used to
identify multicast groups uniquely.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no requirement to extract the host address from the IP address, so Class D does
not have any subnet mask</p>
<p>Example for a Class D IP address:</p>
<p>227.21.6.173</p>
<h1>Class E Network</h1>
<p>Class E IP address is defined by including the starting four network address bits as 1, which allows you
two to incorporate addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. However, E class is reserved, and its
usage is never defined. Therefore, many network implementations discard these addresses as
undefined or illegal.</p>
<p>Example for a Class E IP address:</p>
<p>243.164.89.28</p>

<h1>Class A:</h1> <p> IP addresses between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255</p>
<h1>Class B:</h1> <p> IP addresses between 172.16.0.0 and 172.31.255.255</p>
<h1>Class C:</h1> <p> IP addresses between 192.186.0.0 and 192.168.255.255</p>
<h1>Class D or multicast:</h1> <p> IP addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255</p>
<h1>Class E, which are reserved for experimental usage:</h1> <p> IP addresses between 240.0.0.0 and
254.255.255.254</p>
