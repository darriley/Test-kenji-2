<h1>Motherboard</h1>
<p>A motherboard (also called mainboard, main
circuit board, MB, mboard, backplane board,
base board, system board, mobo, or, in Apple
computers, logic board) is the main printed
circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose
computers and other expandable systems. It
holds and allows communication between
many of the crucial electronic components of
a system, such as the central processing unit
(CPU) and memory, and provides connectors
for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a
motherboard usually contains significant sub-
systems, such as the central processor, the
chipset's input/output and memory
controllers, interface connectors, and other
components integrated for general use,</p>

<p>1. Mouse and keyboard
connectors
Computer motherboards must have two
separate connectors that allow users to
connect their external mouse and
keyboard. These connectors are
responsible for sending instructions and
receiving responses from the computer.
There are two keyboard and mouse
connectors, the PS/2 and the USB. The
personal system/2(PS/2) port is a mini-
DIN plug that contains six pins and
connects the mouse or keyboard to an
IBM-compatible computer. Other
computers use the USB port to connect
the mouse or keyboard.</p>

<p>2. Universal serial bus
(USB)
The USB is a computer interface that
connects computers to other devices,
such as phones. The USB port is a
significant part of a motherboard that
allows users to connect external
peripheral devices such as printers,
scanners, and pen drives to the
computer. Moreover, it enables users to
transfer data between the device and
the computer. A USB port allows users
to connect peripheral devices without
restarting the system. Types of USB
include USB-A, USB-B, USB-mini.
micro-USB, USB-C, and USB-3.</p>

<p>3. CPU
The central processing unit (CPU) is
commonly referred to as the computer's
brain. The CPU controls all the
functions of a computer. CPUs are
available in different form factors, each
requiring a particular slot on the
motherboard. A CPU can contain one or
multiple cores. A CPU with a single core
can only perform a single task at a time,
while those with multiple cores can
execute multiple tasks simultaneously,</p>

<p>4. RAM memory
RAM slots connect the random access
memory (RAM) to the motherboard.
RAM allows the computer to
temporarily store files and programs
that are being accessed by the CPU.
Computers with more RAM capacity can
hold and process larger files and
programs, thus enhancing performance
However, RAM contents are erased
when the computer is shut down. A
computer usually has two RAM slots.
However, some computers have up to
four RAM slots in the motherboard to
increase the available memory.</p>

<p>5. Basic input/output (BIOS)
system
The BIOS contains thefirmwareof the
motherboard. It consists of instructions
about what to do when the computer is
turned on. It is responsible for
initializing the hardware components
and loading the computer's operating
system. The BIOS also allows the
computer's operating system to interact
and respond with input and output
devices such as a mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p>6. Chipsets
The chipsets of a computer control how
the computer hardware and buses
interact with the CPU and other
components. Chipsets also determine
the amount of memory users can add to
a motherboard and the type of
connectors that the motherboard can
have.</p>

<p>7. Cooling fans
The heat generated when electric
current flows between components can
make a computer run slowly. If too
much heat is left to build up unchecked,
it could damage computer components.
Thus, a computer performs better when
kept cool. Cooling fans increase the
airflow, which helps to remove heat
from the computer. Some elements,
such as video adapter cards, have
dedicated cooling fans.</p>

<p>8. Adapter cards and
expansion slots
Adapter cards are integrated into the
motherboard to enhance a computer's
functionality. Examples include sound
and video adapters. The expansion slots
allow users to install compatible adapter
cards. Examples of expansion slots
include the peripheral component
interconnect (PCI) slot, the AGP slot
(which enables the insertion of video
cards), the PCI Express serial bus slot,
and the PCI-extended slot.</p>

<p>9. CMOS battery
The CMOS battery is a small round
battery found on the motherboard of
every computer. It provides power to the
complementary metal oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) chip. The CMOS
chip stores BIOS information and
computer settings, even when powered
down. The CMOS battery allows users to
skip resetting BIOS configurations, such
as boot order, date, and time settings,
each time they power on their
computer.</p>

<p>10. Storage devices
Storage drives store data permanently
or retrieve data from a media disk. The
storage devices can either be installed in
the computer as hard drives or in
removable drives that can connect to
the computer through the USB ports.
Hard disk drives(HDD)_or solid-state
drives_(SSD).
are computers' primary storage drives.
Computers with SSDs execute tasks
much faster and perform better than
HDDs. Users can also use optical drives
such as compact discs to store
information.</p>

<p>11. Front panel connectors
Front panel connectors connect the
light-emitting diode (LED) lights on the
front of the case to the hard drive, the
power button, the reset button, and the
internal speaker for testing. Some USB
and audio devices also have LED lights.</p>

</a></p>

<p>12. Power connector
The power connector provides an
electric supply to the computer to
function as intended. The power supply
connector has 20 pins and converts 110-
V AC power into +/-12-Volt, +/-5-Volt,
and 3.3-Volt direct current (DC) power.</p>
