<h1>Remote desktop</h1>

<p>Use Remote Desktop on your Windows, Android, or
iOS device to connect to a Windows 10 PC from
afar. Here's how to set up your PC to allow remote
connections and then connect to the PC you set up.</p>
<p>Note: While a Remote Desktop server (as in, the
PC that you are connecting to) needs to be
running a Pro edition of Windows, a client
machine (the device you are connecting from) can
be running any edition of Windows (Pro or
Home), or even a different operating system
altogether.</p>

<h1>1. Set up the PC you want to connect to so it
allows remote connections:</h1>
<p>Make sure you have Windows 11 Pro.
To check this, select Start windows , and
open Settings . Then, under System
, select About , and under
Windows specifications, look for
Edition. For info on how to get
Windows 11 Pro, go to Upgrade
Windows Home to Windows Pro.</p>

<p>Make note of the name of this PC
under PC name. You'll need this later.</p>

<h1>2. Use Remote Desktop to connect to the PC
you set up:</h1>
<p>On your local Windows PC: In the
search box on the taskbar, type
Remote Desktop Connection, and
then select Remote Desktop
Connection. In Remote Desktop
Connection, type the name of the PC
you want to connect to (from Step 1),
and then select Connect.</p>
<p>On your Windows, Android, or iOS
device: Open the Remote Desktop app
(available for free from Microsoft Store
Google Play, and the Mac App Store),
and add the name of the PC that you
want to connect to (from Step 1).
Select the remote PC name that you
added, and then wait for the
