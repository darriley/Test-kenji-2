<h1>Computer Assembly</h1>
This intractable will cover the
assembly of a personal computer. I will
leave out what parts to pick because
that is all dependent on the purpose for
your specific computer. The computer I
am assembling is one that I have been
upgrading for the past two years. I
needed to install it into a new case and
decided to document the process to
help others.<p>
