<h1>Mapping A Network</h1>
<p>Map a network drive to get to it from File Explorer in Windows without having to look for it or type its network address each time.</p>
<p>Open File Explorer from the taskbar or the Start  menu, or press the Windows logo key  + E.</p>
<p>Select This PC from the left pane. Then, on the File Explorer ribbon, select More  > Map network drive.</p>
<p>Where to find Map Network Drive in Windows 11 File Explorer</p>
<p>Note: If you don't see Map network drive on the More menu, you can right-click the This PC node in the folder pane and you'll see the command there.</p>
<p>In the Drive list, select a drive letter. (Any available letter will do.)</p>
<p>In the Folder box, type the path of the folder or computer, or select Browse to find the folder or computer. To connect every time you sign in to your PC, select Reconnect at sign-in.</p>
<p>Select Finish.</p>
