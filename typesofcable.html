<h1>Parallel Cables</h1>

<p>Parallel cable assemblies are used to connect two PC's together via parallel ports. Although USB
cables are now more commonplace parallel cables are still needed. The assemblies are used where
older computer peripherals such as printers and scanners need to be connected to computers.</p>

<h1>What Is Straight Through Cable?</h1>

<p>A straight through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to
connect a computer to a network hub such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes
called a patch cable and is an alternative to wireless connections where one or more computers
access a router through a wireless signal. On a a straight through cable, the wired pins
match. Straight through cable use one wiring standard: both ends use T568A wiring standard
or both ends use T568B wiring standard. The following figure shows a straight through cable
of which both ends are wired as the T568B standard.</p>

<h1>What Is Crossover Cable?</h1>
<p>A crossover Ethernet cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing
straight devices together directly. Unlike through cable, the RJ45 crossover cable uses
two different wiring standards: one end uses the T568A wiring standard, and the other
end uses the T568B wiring standard. The internal wiring of Ethernet crossover cables reverses
the transmit and receive signals. It is most often used to connect two devices of the
same type: e.g. two computers (via network interface controller) or two switches to each other. </p>

<h1> Step 1 - Spool out your length of cable</h1>
