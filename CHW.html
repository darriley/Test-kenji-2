<h1> What is computer hardware?</h1>
<p> Computer hardware is a collective term
used to describe any of the physical
components of an analog or digital
computer. The term hardware
distinguishes the tangible aspects of a
computing device from software, which
consists of written, machine-readable
instructions or programs that tell physical
components what to do and when to
execute the instructions.</p>
<p> Hardware and software are
complementary. A computing device can
function efficiently and produce useful
output only when both hardware and
software work together appropriately.<p>
<p> Computer hardware can be categorized
as being either internal or external
components. Generally, internal hardware
components are those necessary for the
proper functioning of the computer, while
external hardware components are
attached to the computer to add or
enhance functionality</p>

<h1> What are internal computer
hardware components?</h1>
<p> Internal components collectively process
or store the instructions delivered by the
program or operating system (OS). These
include the following:</p>
<p> Motherboard. This is a printed circuit
board that holds the central
processing unit (CPU) and other
essential internal hardware and
functions as the central hub that all
other hardware components run
through.</p>
<p> CPU. The CPU is the brain of the
computer that processes and
executes digital instructions from
various programs; its clock speed
determines the computer's
performance and efficiency in
processing data.</p>
<p> RAM. RAM -- or dynamic RAM --is
temporary memory. storage that
makes information immediately
accessible to programs; RAM is
volatile memory, so stored data is
cleared when the computer powers
off.</p>

<p> Hard drive. Hard disk drives are
physical storage devices that store
both permanent and temporary data
in different formats, including
programs, OSes, device files, photos,
etc.</p>
<p> Solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs are
solid-state storage devices based on
NAND flash memory technology;
SSDs are non-volatile, so they can
safely store data even when the
computer is powered down.</p>
<p> Optical drive. Optical drives typically
reside in an on-device drive bay; they
enable the computer to read and
interact with nonmagnetic external
media, such as compact disc read-
only memory or digital video discs.</p>
<p> Heat sink. This is a passive piece of
hardware that draws heat away from
components to regulate/reduce their
temperature to help ensure they
continue to function properly
Typically, a heat sink is installed
directly atop the CPU, which produces
the most heat among internal
components.</p>
<p> Graphics processing unit. This chip-
based device processes graphical
data and often functions as an
extension to the main CPU.</p>

<p> Network interface card (NIC). A NIC is
a circuit board or chip that enables
the computer to connect to a network
also known as a network adapter or
local area network adapter, it typically
supports connection to an Ethernet
network.</p>
