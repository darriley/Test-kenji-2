<h1>FILE SYSTEM</h1>
<p> In computing, a file system or filesystem (often
abbreviated to FS or fs) governs file
organization and access. A /oca/file system is
a capability of an operating system that
services the applications running on the same
computer.[1I21 A distributed file system is a
protocol that provides file access between
networked computers </p>

<p> A file system provides a data storage service
that allows applications to share mass storage
Without a file system, applications could
access the storage in incompatible ways that
lead to resource contention, data corruption
and data loss. </p>

<p> There are many file system designs and
implementations - with various structure and
features and various resulting characteristics
such as speed, flexibility, security, size and
more. </p>

<p> Files systems have been developed for many
types of storage devices, including hard disk
drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs)
magnetic tapes and optical discs. i3) </p>

<p> A portion of the computer main memory can be
set up as a RAM disk that serves as a storage
device for a file system. File systems such as
tmpfs can store files in virtual memory. </p>

<p> A virtua/file system provides access to files
that are either computed on request, called
virtual files (see procfs and sysfs), or are
mapping into another, backing storage. </p>
