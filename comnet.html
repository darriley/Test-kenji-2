<h1>Computer Network Concept</h1>
<p>The term network is any interconnected group of people or things capable of sharing
meaningful information with one another. But in a technology context, network is usually short
for "computer network" or "data network" and implies that computers are the things sharing the
meaningful information. And basically, computer networks are the basis of communication in IT.
Computer networks arc used in a huge variety of ways and can include many different types of
network. It is 9 set of computers that are connected together So that they can share data and
information. At a conceptual level, all data networks are consisting of nodes, which refers to any
computer or digital device using the network and links and the physical connections (either wired
or wireless) that carry messages between nodes.</p>

<h1>Computer networks are used to carry out a large number of tasks through the sharing of
data and information. And some of the things that networks are used for includes;</h1>

<p>Communicating using email, video, instant messaging and other methods;</p>
<p>Sharing devices such as printers, scanners and photocopiers;</p>
<p>Sharing files;</p>
<p>Sharing software and operating programs on remote systems; and</p>
<p>Allowing network users to easily access and maintain information.</p>

<h1>A computer networks can be categorized according to their sizes. A computer network
mainly of four types:</h1>

</a></p>
<p>LAN (Local Arca Network)</p>
<p>PAN (Personal Arca Network)</p>
<p>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</p>
<p>WAN (Wide Area Network)</p>

<h1>LAN (Local Area Netwerk)</h1>
<p>Local Area Network
group of computers that is
connected to each other in a small area such as building or
office.</p>
<p>It is used for connecting two or more personal computers
through a communication medium like twisted pair, coaxial
cable. etc.</p>
<p>It is cheaper compared to any other network as it is built
with inexpensive hardware such as hubs. network adapters,
and ethernet cables.</p>
<p>The data is transferred at an extremely faster rate in LAN.</p>
<p>Local Area Network provides higher security because the
data rotates in small group only.</p>

<h1>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) </h1>
<p>A metropolitan area network covers larger
geographic area. It is composed of a different LAN to
form a larger network.</p>
<p>Government agencies use this kind of network to
connect to the citizens and private industries.</p>
<p>In MAN, various LANs are connected to each other
through a telephone exchange line.</p>

<h1>WAN (Wide Area Network)</h1>
<p>WAN is a network that extends over a large
geographical area such as states or countries.</p>
<p>A Wide Area Network is quite bigger network than
the LAN, MAN and PAN.</p>
<p>WAN is not limited to a single location, but it spans
over a large geographical area through a telephone
line, fibre optic cable or satellite links.</p>
<p>The internet is one of the biggest WAN in the world.</p>
<p>A Wide Area Network is widely used in the field of
Business, government, and education.</p>

<h1>PAN (Personal Area Network)</h1>
<p>PAN is a network arranged within an
individual person, typically within a range of
10 meters.</p>
<p>PAN is used for connecting the computer
devices for personal use.</p>
<p>Thomas Zimmerman was the first research
scientist to bring the idea of the Personal Area
Network.</p>
<p>Personal computer devices that are used to
develop the personal area network are the
laptop, mobile phones, media player and play
stations.</p>
<h1>There are two types of Personal Area Network:</h1>
<p>Wired Personal Area Network - is created by using the USB.</p>
<p>Wireless Personal Area Network - is developed by simply using wireless technologies
such as WiFi or Bluetooth. It is a low range network,</p>
