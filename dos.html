<h1>DISK OPERATING SYSTEM</h1>
<p> What is a disk operating system?
A DOS, or disk operating system, is an
operating system that runs from a disk
drive. The term can also refer to a
particular family of disk operating
systems, most commonly MS-DOS, an
acronym for Microsoft DOS.</p> 

<p> An operating system (OS) is the software
that controls a computer's hardware and
peripheral devices and allows other
software programs to function. Early
computers of the 1940s and 1950s did
not have disk drives. Instead, they were
hard-wired to carry out specific
computations.</p> 

<h1>How does a disk operating system
work?</h1>
<p>When a computer is powered on it goes
through various steps called the boot
process. For a computer running a disk
operating system, the following six steps
are standard:</p>

<p>1.The read-only memory (ROM)
bootstrap loader reads the Master
Boot Record and passes control over
to
it.</p>

<p>2. The boot record loads the disk
operating system into memory, and it
takes control of the machine.</p>

<p>3. The computer transfers data stored
on a magnetic disk to its main
memory, the random access memory.</p>

<p>4. It also transfers data to external
devices attached to the computer,
such as a computer screen or printer.</p>

<p>5. The computer provides various
application programming interfaces
for programs like character
input/output (/0), memory
management, program loading and termination, as well as handling input
from the user through a keyboard.</p>

<p>6. The OS also provides file
management that organizes, reads
and writes files on storage. The files
are organized in a hierarchical
structure of directories, subdirectories
and files.</p>

<p>A disk operating system doesn't have a
graphical user interface (GUI). Its
interface is character-based, so users
must type commands in the command
line to indicate what actions they want.</p>

<h1> DOS features</h1>
<p>Among the features and limitations of
disk operating systems are the following</p>

<h1> Features </h1>
<p>Command-line interface (CLI). It does
not have a GUI and doesn't accept
mouse inputs. It is a character-based
interface system where all
commands are entered in text at the
command-line prompt</p>

<p>Management. A disk operating
system can manage a computer's
files, I/O system and its memory.</p>

<h1> Limitations</h1> 
<p>No built-in security. It does not have
built-in security, such as file
ownership and permissions</p>

<p>No multiusers or multitasking. It also
does not support multiusers or
multitasking. It is only able to run one
program at a time, but it provides
direct access to the basic l/0 system
and underlying hardware.</p>

<p>Challenging interface. The CLI, in
which a user must type in commands,
requires the user to remember
commands to run programs and do
other OS tasks. This approach makes
it difficult for novices to use. For
example, typing the command cd
\directory_name changes the
current working directory to the
named directory and typing the
command dir lists the files in the
current directory.</p>

<h1> Common DOS commands</h1> 
<p>MS-DOS is not case-sensitive, so
commands can be typed in either
uppercase or lowercase. However, other
disk operating systems have case-
sensitive CLIs. DOS commands include
the following.</p>
